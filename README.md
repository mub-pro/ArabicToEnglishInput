## Motivation
After encountering this issue ![issue](issue.gif) in many sites, I decided to make a simple solution for it that works with almost all frameworks and libraries.

## How did I do it?
I used [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/tree/main) to generate the text input for many famous frameworks e.g (React,Solid,Vue,Angular,etc).
