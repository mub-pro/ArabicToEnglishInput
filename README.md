This is a small attempt to enhance the ux for Arabic users on the web/mobile.

In this project I provide a text input in various frameworks that allows the user to type Arabic digits and get the English equivalent.

## How did I do it?
I used [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis/tree/main) to generate the text input for many famous frameworks e.g (React,Solid,Vue,Angular,etc).
